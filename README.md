Updated Plan:

1. Ontop of the Holonomic Drive Frame, we also have a slip gear slingshot powered by two motors and elastic bands.
2. We will have a basic lifs ststem made of one or two motors, which will be optimized for maximum torque. They will power a frame that latches on to the elevation bar.
3. We do not have an autonomous plan yet, but we need to put this on our priorities list. Emil and Eli will go over the rules and write a basic code for optimized scoring during the 15 second period. Without a field to practice on, this code should be as simple as possible.
4. To get the most out of the driver control period, we will have one or two extendable arms that are powered by small motors. These will let us score more triballs.



Original Plan for Drive Train:

1. Title and description of chassis: X-Drive
2. Justification statement for your team's selection including a list of specific objectives: It works well because it is one of the lightest so it will be easier to lift, and it is one of the best for mobility
3. Top down image of your build plan (drawing or digital mockup): The green area is where the wheels will be, and the blue is the frame. There will be a basic claw that can be lifted up and down strong enough to lift the robot
