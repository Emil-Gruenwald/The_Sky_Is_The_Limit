Original Plan:

1. Title and description of chassis: X-Drive
2. Justification statement for your team's selection including a list of specific objectives: It works well because it is one of the lightest so it will be easier to lift, and it is one of the best for mobility
3. Top down image of your build plan (drawing or digital mockup): The green area is where the wheels will be, and the blue is the frame. There will be a basic claw that can be lifted up and down strong enough to lift the robot
